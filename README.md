# React Modals Component
This app demonstrates the use of a modal utility created in React. Via this utility, we can do the following:
- Create, open & close modals from anywhere in the app via a "key" reference
- Modals can stack on top of each other depending on order created
- Modals styled via CSS & can contain any kind of inner HTML
- Add-on: Confirmation modal wrapper with callbacks for onSubmit & onCancel

# Creation Thought Process:
- Check out react portals to limit creation of modals on a different DOM element to keep separation of HTML & for absolute positioning to take effect
- Manage modal state via react context, available on the entire app, with functions exposed to create, open or close modals

# Modals API
- CREATE: Create Modals via a dispatch, with any kind of HTML
- SHOW: Show modals from anywhere in app, via dispatch from context
- CLOSE: Close modals from anywhere in app, via dispatch from context

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
